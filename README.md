Scaffolding tool for AngularJS

AngularJS is great but getting started can be difficult. Unless you are writting
services, directives, filters, etc, day-in day-out, you may not remember all the 
syntax. 

ngneer is there to the rescue! It can be used to generate simple templates 
to get started quickly or add components (service, directive, etc) to 
an existing AngularJS application. 

Based on 
- nodejs
- commanderjs
- nodeunit

## Installation

npm install [-g] ngneer

## Usage

execute ngneer --help to see what's available
